"""
P2b fix coverage: ``agent.runtime.context_compactor.compact_tool_result_content``
must redact forbidden keys at the JSON object level — not by line-based
regex over the raw text.

Background (5-layer audit, v3.10):

  The previous implementation parsed the content with ``json.loads``
  only as a best-effort first step; when the parse succeeded it
  walked dict keys, but the *fallback* path was a line-based regex
  sweep that replaced the entire line with ``[REDACTED]`` whenever
  it saw a forbidden substring. For a single-line JSON input like

    {"username": "abc", "password": "secret123"}

  the regex path matched ``password`` and replaced the whole line
  with ``[REDACTED]``, destroying the JSON envelope.

  The new contract:

    * If the content parses as JSON → redact recursively at the
      object level, keep the structure intact, and ``json.dumps``
      the result.
    * If the content does NOT parse as JSON → fall back to the
      text-scrubbing path. The text-scrubbing path is now the
      *last* resort, not the silent default for the common case.

  These tests cover the JSON path: single-line, multi-line,
  nested, preserved keys, mixed forbidden / preserved.
