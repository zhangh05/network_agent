"""
P2c fix coverage: ``core.tools.integration.get_default_tool_runtime_client``
must be a thread-safe singleton with double-checked locking.

Background (5-layer audit, v3.10):

  The previous implementation read ``_default_client`` outside any
  lock and only took the lock during construction. Two threads that
  both observed ``_default_client is None`` would each build a
  full registry + general-tools + client. This produced:

    * duplicated constructor work,
    * each thread ended up with its own ``ToolRuntimeClient``,
    * downstream code that mutated the singleton (e.g. register a
      runtime-only tool) would silently see inconsistent state.

  The new contract:

    * ``get_default_tool_runtime_client()`` uses a single
      ``threading.Lock`` covering the read+create+assign critical
      section, with a re-check inside the lock (the classic
      double-checked locking pattern).
    * A ``get_default_client_build_count()`` counter exposes how
      many times the heavy ``register_builtin_tools`` /
      ``register_all_general_tools`` work has actually run, so
      tests can assert the singleton is built at most once even
      under contention.
    * A ``reset_default_client_for_tests()`` helper drops the
      cached singleton (and zeros the counter) so tests can start
      from a clean state.

These tests cover single-thread (sanity), multi-thread race
(critical), and the reset helper.
